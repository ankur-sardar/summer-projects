# Positioning System

## Overview

This project helps in keeping track of the position of the employees via the ***BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons*** which send Bluetooth signals at a constant rate. These signals are then, in turn received by the receivers and sent to the server, which keeps track of the *in-times* and *out-times* of the employees. The position of the employees are visualized by a webpage.
